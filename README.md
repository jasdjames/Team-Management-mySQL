## Description 
This is project is a inquiry-based database generation and creation application. The application works primarily as expected with the exception of the update option in which I hit some serious roadblocks. I am certain that I was very close to a solution but simply ran out of time. I worked collaboratively with many classmates, followed class activities, was assisted by my tutor, and used online resources.
